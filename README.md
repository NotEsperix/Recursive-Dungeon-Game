# Recursive Dungeon

## Overview

Welcome to **Recursive Dungeon**, an auto-generated dungeon rogue-lite shooter game. This game combines challenging gameplay with dynamic levels and vibrant soundtracks to create an immersive gaming experience. Developed using the Godot Engine, **Recursive Dungeon** showcases my journey in mastering game development and demonstrates the skills I have acquired in a short period.

## Features

- **Dynamic Sound and Music**: Enjoy an original soundtrack that enhances the mood and atmosphere of each dungeon level.
- **Cross-Platform Play**: Designed to be played across multiple platforms, ensuring accessibility and a broad audience reach.

## Development

This project began as an exercise for an online class on the Godot Engine, but soon morphed into a platform for creative exploration and technical demonstration. Throughout development, I expanded upon the class's base curriculum, adding unique features and personal touches that showcase my growth and understanding of game mechanics and software development.

## Technologies

- **Godot Engine**: Utilized for overall game development, providing a robust framework for creating detailed game environments and mechanics.
- **GDScript**: The primary scripting language used for game logic and interactions.
- **Adobe Audition**: Used for editing and refining all in-game sounds and music tracks.
